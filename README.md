# AIO-Miner-Tool

This tool is intended to be a replacement for my Claymore-miner-gui tool, which serves two functions: Downloads the correct miner tool for a popular Cryptocurrency of your choice, and helps you create a configuration file for the miner that was downloaded. Right now it should work as intended but more work is needed. Funcionality is basic but useful for new miners who are not too tech-literate. 

If you would like to donate to the project, my ETH address is 0xc81f792CC0D4845CAfB7E077463E6fF3c574a508 :)
